# Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains my implementation of Quanvolutional Neural Network presented by [1]. With respect to [1], this implementation is more flexible, allows to change the quantum circuit strcuture, the kernel size, the stride and the output filters. This implementation allows also to use images with more channels and to stack multiple Quantum Convolutional 2D layers.

## Contents

The repository contains several jupyter notebook that must be runned in a precise order

1.[*Quantum Convolutional Processing*](Quantum Convolutional Processing.ipynb): this notebook shows how to load a dataset, how to apply quantum convolution to precces it and how to save results
2.[*Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks*](Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks.ipynb): this notebook loads the quantum processed dataset and run the classification of the dataset
3.

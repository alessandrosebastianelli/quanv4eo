- Dummy.ipynb: script to test compatibility of jax, jaxlib and pennylane versions. 

- QuantumConvNN_mashup_tf.ipynb: class file to implement quanvolutional preprocessing and cassical training at once. Uses tensorflow. 

- QuantumConvNN_mashup_tf.ipynb: class file to implement quanvolutional preprocessing and cassical training at once. Doesn't use tensorflow, only JAX. 
Please note that jax allows to build a neural network from scratch.
